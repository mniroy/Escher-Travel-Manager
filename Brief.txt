Brief: Escher Travel Manager

A smart, mobile-first travel itinerary application designed for dynamic schedule management.

## Core Features Implementated

### 1. Smart Timeline & Scheduling
- **Dynamic Time Ripple**: Automatically recalculates the entire day's schedule when an event's time changes or is checked into.
- **Check-In System**: "Check In" button sets an activity's start time to "Now" and pushes all subsequent activities forward.
- **Skip Logic**: "Skip" button marks an activity as skipped (greyed out), removing its duration and pulling subsequent activities back to fill the gap.
- **Travel Time Integration**: Displays estimated travel duration and mode (Walk/Drive/Transit) between consecutive locations on the connector line.

### 2. Interactive "Edit Mode"
- **Toggleable Interface**: A dedicated "Edit" toggle switches the view to manageable mode.
- **Smart Insert Zones**: "Insert Here" buttons appear between every timeline item to add new activities at precise locations.
- **Quick Actions**: One-tap delete with confirmation dialog.
- **In-Place Editing**: Tap any card in edit mode to modify details (Time, Title, Duration, Links).
- **Undo History**: 5-step undo capability to revert accidental changes.

### 3. Activity Management
- **Add Activity Modal**: Supports inputting Title, Type, Visit Duration, and Google Maps Links.
- **Duration Stepper**: Custom ±30 minute stepper control for easy duration adjustments.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter timeline by Transport, Stay, Eat, or Play.
- **Smart Parsing (Mock)**: "Paste & Preview" flow to interpret raw text into structured itinerary data.

### 4. UI/UX Design
- **Mobile-First Actions**: Important actions (Check In, Skip, Insert) are always visible and touch-friendly, not hidden behind hovers.
- **Visual Statuses**: Distinct visual states for "Scheduled", "Checked In", and "Skipped" items.
- **Glassmorphism Aesthetic**: Modern dark-themed UI with translucent panels and vibrant accents.
- **Travel Badges**: Centered badges on the timeline connector showing travel time and mode.
