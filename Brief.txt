Brief: Escher Travel Manager

A smart, mobile-first travel itinerary application designed for dynamic schedule management.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Timeline & Scheduling
- **Dynamic Time Ripple**: Automatically recalculates the entire day's schedule when an event's time changes or is checked into.
- **Check-In System**: "Check In" button sets an activity's start time to "Now" and pushes all subsequent activities forward.
- **Skip Logic**: "Skip" button marks an activity as skipped (greyed out), removing its duration and pulling subsequent activities back to fill the gap.
- **Travel Time Integration**: Displays estimated travel duration and mode (Walk/Drive/Transit) between consecutive locations on the connector line.

### 2. Interactive "Edit Mode"
- **Toggleable Interface**: A dedicated "Edit" toggle switches the view to manageable mode.
- **Smart Insert Zones**: "Insert Here" buttons appear between every timeline item to add new activities at precise locations.
- **Quick Actions**: One-tap delete with confirmation dialog.
- **In-Place Editing**: Tap any card in edit mode to modify details (Time, Title, Duration, Links).
- **Undo History**: 5-step undo capability to revert accidental changes.

### 3. Activity Management
- **Add Activity Modal**: Supports inputting Title, Type, Visit Duration, and Google Maps Links.
- **Duration Stepper**: Custom ±30 minute stepper control for easy duration adjustments.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter timeline by Transport, Stay, Eat, or Play.
- **Smart Parsing (Mock)**: "Paste & Preview" flow to interpret raw text into structured itinerary data.

### 4. Smart Optimization & Routing
- **One-Tap Optimization**: "Optimize Route" feature reorders the day's events simulation to improve efficiency, complete with loading states and fluid animations.
- **Dark Mode Map**: Route Map page fully themed to match the app's "Black & Blue" aesthetic (removing standard map colors).
- **Integrated Date Picker**: Map page features a horizontal date selector synced with the main itinerary context to visualize routes for specific days.
- **Smart Route Details**: Floating route card displays optimized stop info and dynamically updates based on the selected date.

### 5. Intelligent Document Management
- **AI Auto-Categorization**: Files are automatically tagged (Transport, Stay, Identity, Finance) based on filename analysis.
- **Smart Boarding Pass Import**: Uploading a file named "boarding pass" triggers an automated workflow that creates a new Flight Card directly in the Itinerary.
- **Contextual Sorting**: Options to sort documents by "Recent" or "Group by Category" with clean section headers.
- **Professional UI**: Muted, non-neon color palette for file types, ensuring a clean and legible document list.

### 6. UI/UX Refinement
- **Native Typography**: Implemented San Francisco system font stack for a premium, platform-native textual experience.
- **Premium Dark Theme**: Removed excessive "glow" effects in favor of sophisticated high-contrast dark grays and solid blue (#007AFF) accents.
- **Fluid Motion**: Integrated `framer-motion` for smooth layout transitions when reordering or adding items.
